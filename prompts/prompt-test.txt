When you come accross the message I am about to attach, check whether it has information similar to this:
<info> 🚀 PUMP ANNOUNCEMENT

📅 DATE: WEDNESDAY 18th September
⏰ TIME: 5pm GMT 
📈 Exchange: Mexc.com 
🪙 PAIR: USDT

Remember to read the guide below if it’s your first time pumping with us.
</info>

The output should be in accordance with the following JSON schema:

{'datetime': '2024-09-18T17:00', exchange:'mexc.com', pair: 'USDT', guess: false}

If you don't find the year for the datetime, default to the current year. The time should be in the 24h format


Another message that match this format can be:
<info>
‼PUMP ANNOUNCEMENT‼

🌐Pump Date: Wednesday September 11
🌐Time: 16:00 pm GMT
🌐Exchange: RAYDIUM (Solana)

After the massive success of our previous market...
</info> 
In this case you are to ignore the excess text and only return the output using the format specified before

If in the message provided, you are not able to fetch exhange AND the time, return an empty dictionary '{}' and terminate.

If you have managed to find the exchange and the time, but not the pair, return 'USDT' as the default and return 'guess' = True. But if you haven't located the exchange and the time, then don't do this.

DONOT start the output with json'''
